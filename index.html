<h3> [XBOX 360] Dance Central Review</h3>
<div>
Hi! Welcome to the first post of Tanoshidesu! I decided to make a review of the Dance Central Trilogy (not Spotlight) because I'm really addicted to it right now. <br>
Dance Central is the first game of the trilogy, so in this review I'm going to write about it's formula. Like Rock Band, you need to get certain moves to gain points and get a multiplier bonus. It's not complicated, and you will get it when you play.<br>
<ul>
<li>Gameplay</li>
It's very fun to play Dance Central. The moves are very smooth (and the franchise only gets better in moves), and the Kinect sensor really works good (much better than Kinect Adventures and Kinect Sports). The difficult is great, there are Easy, Medium and Hard, and they live up to their names. You can also use the "Break It Down" to learn how to dance to a song easily. Also, the Kinect controls are, in my opinion, the best that Kinect can offer and no other game (at least that I know) did better than the Dance Central trilogy in this topic.  <br>
There are some things that really bother me in this Dance Central. The first one, you need to play a song on Easy difficult, then in Medium difficult, then you unlock Hard. If you are a really good dance and only play on Hard, this is really boring; the second one is the freestyle (where you do your own moves and the Kinect take some pictures). I think it's really boring, and in the first Dance Central you can't turn it off, but you can do it in DC2 and DC3 I recommend turning it off because the best moves of the song are in the freestyle part. <br>
Overall: it's very fun to play, dance, lose some weight, and you can learn some new moves for your dancing. 
<li>Multiplayer gameplay</li>
Unlike DC2 and DC3, in the first Dance Central two players can't play at the same time: each player play 50% of the song. This makes me choosing other Dance Central games among this one when I want to local multiplayer. The only online feature is leaderboards. <br>
 Overall: DC2 and DC3 are way better in multiplayer, because two players can both play at the same time. But, you can import your songs to DC2 and DC3, and this fix it (see the Import topic).
<li> Soundtrack </li>
The second most important thing is a musical game. The soundtrack is really good, and like Rock Band, it makes you addicted to some songs (even songs you hated). The moves, in most (read: most) of the time, are related to their original coreography. There are a lot of genres, like hip-hop, pop and funk. There are 32 downloadable songs that you can buy using Xbox Live, and these songs are compatible with DC2 and DC3 too, like the 31 on-dics songs of DC as well. . <br>
You can check every song of any DC game, including DLC, by clicking <a href="http://www.harmonixmusic.com/games/dance-central/legacy-songs/">here</a>. It will take you to the Harmonix website.  <br>
Overall: the soundtrack is very good, many memorable songs and coreographys, and if you own DC1 and their DLC you can import then to DC2 and DC3, and Dance Central Spotlight too.
<li> Art </li>
The art in this game is very unique. There is a lot of different characters and venues, each one with it's own design. The graphics are good, and the special effects are really good too. <br>
Overall: a very good art for a musical game, with unique artsyle and good graphics.
<li> Characters </li>
There are 9 characters for the first Dance Central, every one of them are very unique and you will certain have a new love (yes, this means I will make a review of Romance Central in the future!). Unlike Just Dance, Dance Central lets you choose your character and venue, this is a differencial but in terms of atmosfere Just Dance is really better. <br>
Overall: they really did a good job with characters, and it only gets better! 
<li> Import </li>
You can import the on-disc songs to DC2 and DC3. You must need your physical copy of the game, and a code that come in the manual. You must open DC2/DC3, and choose "Import Offer" in the store. Yeah, you need to pay. This is a really good feature. <br>
The downloadable content on your gametag automatically goes to DC2, DC3 and DC Spotlight.

<li> Conclusion </li>
If you picked Kinect, the Dance Central trilogy is a must-have. The first game can lack on some features, but it's a great game. I do not recommend playing it first, you will lose nothing, so you can play Dance Central 3 as your first entry to the series.
